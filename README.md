# MyBB-Jabber (XMPP)-Integration
As MyBB Group still hasn't been able to integrate Jabber as normal IM Field, I made my own plugin. This Addon is a port from vBulletin Jabber Integration ( https://github.com/Sebijk/vBulletin-Jabber-Integration ). 

# WARNING

This plugin was never finished and has alpha status. Only the settings and the Jabber IM Field is integrated. I you want finish this development, feel free to fork. It should have the same functions like the plugin for vBulletin.

## Requirements
xmpphp: https://code.google.com/archive/p/xmpphp/ (but not implemented yet)

## PHP Version
Minimal PHP 5.2, but PHP 5.2.6 is recommended.

## License
This Product is licensed under the GPL License.

## NOTE
Last update of this Plugin was 2012.
